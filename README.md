# Popular Movies

*In this project, you will build an app to help users discover popular and recent movies. You will build a clean UI, sync to a server, and present detailed information of each movie, allowing users to 'favorite' movies.*
## NOTE: 
To run this app, you must also have an [API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) defined as a variable named `API_KEY` in the project's `com.example.popularmovies.network.ApiHandler.java` file.
